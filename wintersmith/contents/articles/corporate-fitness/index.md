Here’s an interesting fact. The health habits of employees, or lack of them, contribute to almost 23 million work days a year being lost due to work-related illness. So what is the big deal about this whole thing called ‘Corporate Fitness’?

Corporate fitness directly relates to the productivity and profitability of a business. Unless a business has healthy and fit employees, it cannot make survive in today’s cut throat market and economy. For employers, this means making sure that your employees are healthy and motivated to keep working hard day after day. For employees, this means staying focused and on task throughout the work day in order to reach their maximum productivity.

The success of corporate wellness is driven by the unique strategy behind it. It involves a framework that outlines short and long-term goals for the employee and the employer. Corporate wellness needs support, leadership, commitment from the vendor, employer and employees. A successful program takes time and constantly evolves so it can be integrated into the fabric of the company’s culture. Corporate wellness is not just one solution. It is the culmination of many solutions that work together under one strategy. It involves layers of physical activity, education, communication, incentives, and a long term commitment.

Things to do in the shorter term include realizing smaller things like sitting down at desks and working hard for hours on end, your employees are actually doing more harm to their health than good. Workplace wellness programs can help you get healthier, even if that simply means learning how to reduce stress and muscle strain when you are on the job. Depending on what your company offers, it might also help to lose weight, lower your cholesterol and blood pressure, sleep better, and save money on prescriptions. 

But, sometimes, all you need is a little motivation to get the ball rolling and a workplace wellness plan might be it.
