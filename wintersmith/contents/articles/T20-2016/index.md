** T20 2016 **

Suresh Raina produced an innings of great composure to help India to a thrilling last-ball victory over Australia in the third and final T20 International match. Raina smashed a 25-ball-49, never once appearing flustered, as India chased down a total of 197 at the SCG to sweep the KFC T20 series 3-0.


The match was not about just a win or a sweet for India. It was full of nail biting moments that kept viewers at the edge of their seat! Each team member did their bit and they did it the best!

Dhawan’s exit only heralded the arrival of Virat Kohli. He and Rohit Sharma continued their golden run in this land, scoring yet another pair of half-centuries. Sharma was out for 52, caught at midwicket off Cameron Boyce. The leg-spinner should have dismissed Raina two balls later, but the wicket-keeper Cameron Bancroft, making his debut here, bungled what ought to have been a simple stumping. Raina was on 0 then. Next ball, he hammered Boyce for six.

The men in blue spelt magic on the grounds! They did not just display a good game for the viewers across the globe, but also stood as a team, decided to win and hit the winning stroke with such ease! A great team, brains to the game, victory in the heart and a mind driven by goal and determination made the victory possible and a reality!
